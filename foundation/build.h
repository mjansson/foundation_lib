\brief Build setup

Build setup. This header contains all the compile time build setup for the foundation library.
This header unifies the debug/release build macros across platforms, build systems and compiler
and provides the following macro idenfiers, usable with <i>\#if BUILD_[type]</i> conditionals.

<ul>
<li>BUILD_DEBUG   - Debug build
<li>BUILD_RELEASE - Release build
<li>BUILD_PROFILE - Deploy build with profiling
<li>BUILD_DEPLOY  - Deploy build
</ul>

Feature enable/disable control is made through the various <i>BUILD_ENABLE_[...]</i>
preprocessor definitions declared in this header. The value of a flag is interpreted as
disabled if the value is 0, and enabled for all other values (with 1 being the normal value
for enabled). These enable flags can also be set externally on compilation command lines or
in source files prior to inclusion of foundation headers. Note that some affect if source
code is compiled in or discarded in the library, so it is recommended to set all values
inside this header. */

#include <foundation/platform.h>

/*! \def BUILD_DEBUG
Set to 1 for debug build, 0 otherwise. Debug builds are by default unoptimized with
full debugging functionality enabled such as asserts, logging, memory tracking and other
features.

\def BUILD_RELEASE
Set to 1 for release build, 0 otherwise. Release builds are by default optimized but
with a normal set of debugging functionality enabled such as asserts, some logging and
memory tracking.

\def BUILD_PROFILE
Set to 1 for profile build, 0 otherwise. Profile builds are by default fully optimized
and all debugging functionality disabled, but with profiling calls enabled.

\def BUILD_DEPLOY
Set to 1 for deploy build, 0 otherwise. Deploy builds are by default fully optimized
and have all debugging and profiling functionality disabled.

\def BUILD_ENABLE_ASSERT
Control if runtime asserts are enabled. Default value is enabled in debug and release
builds, and disabled in profile and deploy builds. If asserts are disabled, all assert
macros will reduce to void (no evaluated code). See assert.h documentation for more
information on asserts.

\def BUILD_ENABLE_ERROR_CONTEXT
Control if error context tracking is enabled. Default value is enabled in debug and
release builds, and disabled in profile and deploy builds. If error context tracking is
disabled, all calls to set error context will reduce to void (no evaluated code). See
error.h documentation for more information on error context tracking.

\def BUILD_ENABLE_LOG
Control if logging is enabled. Default value is enabled in debug and release builds
on all platforms, disabled in profile and deploy builds on console/mobile platform families,
and enabled in profile and deploy builds on all other platforms. If logging is disabled, all
calls to log functions will reduce to void (no evaluated code). See log.h documentation for
more information on log functions.

\def BUILD_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOG
Control if debug logging is enabled. Similar to BUILD_ENABLE_LOG, but explicitly controls
debug level logging. Default value is enabled in debug builds, and disabled in all other
builds. Depends on #BUILD_ENABLE_LOG

\def BUILD_ENABLE_PROFILE
Control if profiling is enabled. Default value is enabled in debug, release and profile
builds, and disabled in deploy builds. If profiling is disabled, all calls to profile
functions will reduce to void (no evaluated code). See profile.h documentation for more
information on profiling calls.

\def BUILD_ENABLE_MEMORY_CONTEXT
Control is memory context tracking is enabled. Default value is enabled in debug and
release builds, and disabled in profile and deploy builds. If memory context tracking
is disabled, all calls to track memory context will reduce to void (no evaluated code).
See memory.h documentation for more information on memory context tracking.

\def BUILD_ENABLE_MEMORY_TRACKER
Control if memory tracking is enabled. Default value is enabled in debug and release
builds, and disabled in profile and deploy builds. If memory tracking is enabled, each
memoruy allocation and deallocation will incur a slight overhead to track the origin of
the call and enable memory leak detection. For more information on memory tracking, check
the memory.h documentation.

\def BUILD_ENABLE_MEMORY_GUARD
Control if memory guarding is enabled. Default value is enabled in debug and release
builds, and disabled in profile and deploy builds. Memory guarding incurs a slight memory
overhead on each allocation, and enables over/underwrite detection on memory deallocation.
For more information on memory guarding, check the memory.h documentation.

\def BUILD_ENABLE_MEMORY_STATISTICS
Enable gathering of memory allocation statistics. By default enabled in debug and release
builds, disabled in profile and deploy builds.

\def BUILD_ENABLE_STATIC_HASH_DEBUG
Control if static string hashing debugging is enabled. Default value is enabled in debug
and release builds on desktop platforms, and disabled all other build configurations
and/or platforms. Static string hash debugging enables sanity checking in statically
hashed strings, as well as reverse lookup of string hashes. See hash.h documentation for
more information on statically hashed strings.

\def BUILD_MONOLITHIC
Control if tests are built as a single monolithic binary or as one executable per
test case. Default is enabled on mobile/console platforms and code coverage builds,
and disabled in all other configurations.
